## Automatic GUI creator. (For ROBLOX Studio)

Creates an instant GUI for you without having to create one yourself, Just edit some properties and THERE you go!

Currently it is in pre-development mode which means It can be improved way more. 

I have considerably left developing this as I don't have the motivation anymore to actually work on it. 

______________________________________________________________

Currently it accepts these arguments:

createBasicGui(*nameplox, parent[Grammar matters]*) - Creates a screenGui in the StarterGui with the name you define it as. 

createBasicFrame(*framename,sizex,sizey,posx,posy,drag*) drag = Boolean Value 

createBasicTextButton(*par,textbuttonname,sizex,sizey,posx,posy,textwrapbol*) textwrapbol = Boolean Value

createImageLabel(*par,imgname,imgsource,sizex,sizey,posx,posy,transpare,bordercolor,bordersize*) transpare = Number value

createImageButton(Same as createImageLabel)

createBasicTextBox(textboxname, sizex, sizey, posx, posy, textwrapbol, multiline,par)

Added some more arguments. Now you can set your own directory to a frame you created.
