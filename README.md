## Automatic GUI creator. (For ROBLOX Studio)

Creates instantly a GUI for you without having to create one yourself...Just edit some propertys and THERE you go!

Currently it is in nooby verison but it's pretty cool. Going to update it more often. 

______________________________________________________________

Currently it accepts these arugements:

createBasicGui(*nameplox*) - Creates a screenGui in the StarterGui with the name you define it as. 

createBasicFrame(*framename,sizex,sizey,posx,posy*) 

createBasicTextButton(*textbuttonname,sizex,sizey,posx,posy*)

Will add more arugements later.
